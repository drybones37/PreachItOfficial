INTRODUCTION:

Preach It! Is a game designed to be used as a tool in the task of fulfilling the Great Commission of “making disciples,
teaching them to obey everything that Jesus has commanded us”. (Matthew 28:19-20) The purpose of the game is to
provide a fun context in which to train players in learning, knowing and understanding the fundamental principles of
following Jesus, and knowing how to deal with the many arguments that are presented in real life regarding that
subject. (2 Corinthians 10:4-5)

The game has been created by people who have dedicated their lives to being and making disciples of Jesus, and is
based on the memory verse cards included in the game. These focus on themes related to following Jesus, and not so
much on the many theological issues that do not affect a true Christian discipleship. Many of the subjects included
are often considered fairly “radical” by many religious people. However, it is our understanding that the path Jesus
proposes is the only path that leads to eternal life, and that we should give it due consideration before dismissing it as
being “too radical”. Having said that, the game does not limit itself to the knowledge gained through the memory
verse cards. Anybody can use their previous independent biblical knowledge to arm sermons in response to the
arguments raised in the game.

We hope the game inspires good talks, debates and mature perspectives with regard to what it means to follow Jesus.


THE GAME:

The game consists of players, represented by disciple tokens, coming out of “The System” and travelling along the
path of Learning, Training, Maturity, and Leadership, while they gain experience, evangelize, make disciples, and
face challenges, until “through trials and tribulations” they enter “Heaven”.


RULES FOR THE GAME:

It's important that at least one person understand the rules of the game (which are explained in this document) before
setting out to play. The rules are fairly in depth and may take some time to understand them well. However, the rules
are designed to enable learning, decision making, and for fun. A summary of the rules is provided on a separate
sheet, and serves as reference and a quick guide to the rules explained in this document.


PREPARATIONS

Before starting the game, it must be decided how many players will participate and possibly divide the tasks of the
game between the various players. One player may be chosen to be in charge of all the elements of the game, or the
tasks may be divided amongst many (e.g. the task of handing out tokens, memory verse cards, preach it! cards,
measuring time, etc.). The following components of the game must be available and placed on the table:

The Board. (It should be opened and placed in the centre of the table).

Disciple Tokens (1 Disciple Token for each player - each one of a different colour - is placed on the board within the
section labelled “The System”)

The two dice are placed in the center of the board.

The two trains, one placed in the station at Preach It! 2 X! and one placed in the station at Preach It! 3 X! (The
stations are located at the corners of the board.)

The Preach It! cards (separated into 3 decks according to the colours of the cards) along with the sand clock timer, are
placed in front of the player who is in charge of handing out the Preach It! cards and measuring time with the clock.

The memory verse cards (MVC) (in front of the player in charge of handing them out throughout the game)The Opportunity! cards (!) (in front of the player in charge of reading them out)

The tokens (Fellowship tokens -which have a handshake symbol-, Bible tokens -which have a Bible symbol-, and
Experience tokens -which have a X! symbol) in front of player in charge of handing them out throughout the game.

A collection of “Tracts” placed in front of the player assigned with handing them out throughout the game.

The Summary of Rules Sheet and Study Sheet available for reference.

One Bible (preferably with both Old and New Testament) available for use throughout the game.


HOW TO WIN

To win the game, players must make at least one Disciple and enter Disciples into “Heaven”. Once in Heaven these
Disciples are referred to as “saved”. The number of saved Disciples needed to win the game is decided upon at the
beginning of the game, depending on how many players will participate, their level of experience with the game, and
how long the players would roughly like the game to take. The longer the game, the more opportunity there is for
learning, as more arguments are presented throughout the game, but the more risk there is of some players getting
tired or feeling bored.

Here is a chart showing an estimation of the time it takes for different settings of the game (between number of
players and how many saved disciples are required to win the game). NOTE: Even in games that only require one
saved Disciple to win the game, the player must actually make another Disciple before landing one in Heaven.

-----------------------------------------------------

TURNS:
Turns are taken one at a time, in anticlockwise direction (i.e. towards the player on the right). To decide who the first
person is to play, each player throws a die, and the person with the highest roll starts the game.

Every player starts with a Disciple Token in “The System” and rolls only one die to get their Disciple out from “The
System” and onto the outer path of the board.

A player's turn consists of rolling the dice, moving their disciple tokens, completing a tasked assigned on that turn
(e.g. Preach It!, Opportunity!, Persecution!, etc), resuming a task that was left pending from their previous turn (e.g.
Exam!, Martyrdom!).

At the end of a player's turn, they have the option of acquiring Disciples, Fellowship Tokens, Bible Tokens and Tracts
with their Experience Tokens (X!), be it from the “bank” or by trading with other players. (NOTE: The “bank” refers
to any components (tokens, etc.) not belonging to any player.) Once the player is satisfied with their trading, their
turn is over and it becomes the next player's turn (the player to the right).

The rates for exchanging X! for other things from the “bank” are:

Memory Verse Card = 1 X!
Tract = 2 X!
Bible Token = 3 X!
Fellowship Token =3 X!
Disciple = 4 X! (NOTE: The only way to “make Disciples” in the game is through exchanging 4 X! for one of them,
or through rare Opportunity! cards)

NOTE: Players cannot exchange any of these tokens for X! from the bank (ie. “sell” their tokens to the bank), but
they may sell them to other players (at whatever price of X! they agree to) before the end of their turn.


MOVEMENTS

The movements of Disciples are decided by the roll of the dice, be it a single die or both dice, and moving the number
of squares indicated by the dice (going in an anticlockwise direction around the board). The rules for rolling the dice
are as follows:

1. To leave “The System” the player must roll only one die and move the number of squares indicated by the die,
starting with the first square in the “Learning” path (which is the “Memory Verse Cards” square). The first disciple
of each player to leave “The System” is called “The Pioneer”.

2. Each player is permitted a maximum of 2 Disciples in play at any one time (a third Disciple may be waiting in
“The System” but cannot leave until one of the two currently in play reaches Heaven.). When one of the player's
Disciples enters Heaven, the other Disciple remaining in play takes on the roll of “The Pioneer”.

3. Player's may choose to roll either one die or two dice during any turn. However, if the player chooses to roll two
dice, they may not complete tasks requiring the roll of only one die (e.g. leave “The System” or enter the “Path of
Tribulations”).

4. If the player has only one Disciple in play, and they roll with one die, they move that disciple the number of
squares indicated by the die. If they roll with two dice, they must move the number of squares indicated by the sum of
the dice.

5. If the player has TWO Disciples in play, and they roll with one die, they may choose which Disciple to move the
number of squares indicated by the die. If they roll with two dice, they may assign the number of each die to each of
their Disciples, as per the player's choice, in which case the square landed on by the Pioneer is the square activated on
that turn. Otherwise, they may choose to use the sum of the dice to move only one of their disciples.

6. To enter the “Path of Tribulations” (the grey path leading to Exam!) the player must have 3 X! available to be
handed in to the “bank” the moment they enter the Path of Tribulations. To enter, they must have rolled one die only.
(If they had rolled two dice, they cannot enter the Path of Tribulations, even if they split the value of the dice between
two of their Disciples). Once inside, they may only move their disciple along the Path of Tribulations by using only
one die.


SQUARES

Each square has a function. Upon landing on the square, the player must fulfill the function of that particular square.
The different squares of the outer path and their functions, in order of appearance are:

MEMORY VERSE CARDS: The player receives two Memory Verse Cards (MVC). They player must learn
these MVC to enter Heaven. In the event of an Exam, the player may use the MVC already acquired to be tested on
them in preference to new ones. This gives the player the benefit of being able to study and review them throughout
the game before the Exam takes place. Learning them requires the player to remember in which Book(s) and
Chapter(s) the statement made on the front of the MVC is found in the Bible. They are not requiered to remember the
verse numbers, unless that rule has been decided upon at the start of the game.

TRACTS: The player receives 1 Tract. The tracts can be used when the player has to preach and does not wish to
do so (be it to save time, or because they are not comfortable with the argument raised by the Preach It! card).
Regardless of how many X! the player would normally win from Preach It!, if they decide to use a Tract instead of
preaching, they receive 1X! at the time of handing the Tract in.

FELLOWSHIP: The player receives 1 Fellowship Token. The Fellowship Token can be used when the player has
to preach and wishes that someone else preach in their place. They may choose any player to preach in their place. If
nobody refutes the substitute player or the subsitute player wins the refutation, the original player who used the
Fellowship Token AND the substitute player win the amount of X! indicated by the Preach It! square. If the
substitute player loses the refutation, both that player and the original player give 1 X! to the refutor.

BIBLE: The player receives 1 Bible Token. The Bible Tokens can be used in two different ways. When the player
has to preach and cannot remember a Bible reference to give to support their argument, they may hand in a Bible
Token to cancel out that requirement. Also, during an Exam (unless indicated by an Opportunity Card), the player
may use 1 Bible Token for every MVC the player wishes to cancel out (ie. they do not have to pass that MVC).

PRAYER: The player receives 1 X! and frees any disciples (of any player) that are in prison. The player also
has the option of requesting a 1 minute silent prayer to pray about an issue of their choice.

TRAIN STATION: There are four train stations located on the corners of the board. There are two trains in play.
The trains start at the stations marked with Preach It! 2 X! and Preach It! 3 X!.
If a player lands on a station that does not have a train there, the square is considered a Preach It! square,
(rules on Preach It! squares are further below). If the player wins the sermon, they win the amount of X! shown at the
station.

If a player lands on a station and there is a train there, they must take the train and follow the tracks to a
station (of their choice, if available) that does not have a train. The tracks are laid in such a way that any one
station can only reach two other stations (e.g. there is no connecting track between the Preach It! 5 X! station and the
Preach It! 2 X! station). Once they reach an empty station, the disciple gets off the train and remains at that square
until the player's next turn.

OPPORTUNITY! (!): An Opportunity! Card is drawn from the pile and read out loud for the player by the
person in charge of the Opportunity! Cards. (In the event that the player who landed on the Opportunity square is
also the one in charge of the cards, a different player reads it out loud for them.). The player then follows any
instructions indicated by the Opportunity! Card. Opportunity! Cards provide surprises, benefits and challenges for
players which may help or hinder them in the game.

PREACH IT!: A Preach It! Card is drawn from the pile matching the color of the square the player landed on
and handed to the player. The Preach It! cards are assorted by the level of difficulty in an argument or issue, yellow
cards being basic, orange intermediate, and red advanced. Immediately, when the player receives the Preach It! card,
the sand clock timer is started by the person in charge of it. The player is given two minutes in total to first read out
loud the Preach It! card, decide and announce which conclusion they will take (true, depends or false) and preach a
short and convincing sermon in response to the argument raised on the Preach It! card. (NOTE: The sand clock timer
is of 1 minute duration and must be turned again at the end of the first minute by the person in charge of the timer).

The player must give at least 1 Bible reference to support their argument. The book and chapter of the Bible is
enough, unless a different rule (e.g. must include the verse as well, or must be read out from the Bible) was
established at the start of the game.If they player gives a convincing argument, supported by at least 1 Bible reference, and nobody wishes to refute or
challenge the sermon, then the player receives the amount of Experience Tokens (X!) indicated by the square on
which they landed.

If the player cannot or does not give a Bible reference to support their sermon, it is considered an invalid sermon, and
the player is fined the amount of X! indicated by the square on which they landed. (If they do not have enough X! to
pay the fine, they pay all the X! they have). However, if the player had a Bible Token and used it during the sermon
(by indicating that they were using it in place of a Bible reference) then the sermon is considered to be valid, and the
player is not fined.

If upon receiving and reading out the Preach It! card, the player does not wish to preach or does not know how to
respond to the argument raised, they may pay a fine (the amount of X! indicated by the square on which they landed),
use a Tract (by returning it to the “bank”) to cancel out the requirement to preach (in which case they earn only 1 X!,
regardless of the Preach It! square they landed on) or they may choose to request the “Study Sheet”. In the latter
case, the player is not fined, the player's turn is over and they are given the Study Sheet to read until their next turn,
when they will have an opportunity to preach on that same Preach It! card. The Study Sheet contains a list of
arguments organized by themes with the Bible references indicated next to each statement. Each Preach It! card has a
note on the bottom indicating the card's theme (e.g. Salvation, Obedience, etc) and the player can use this as a guide
for where to find arguments and Bible references for their particular Preach It! card. NOTE: The player remains on
that Preach It! square each turn until they are able to preach a sermon, or they are fined the amount of X!
corresponding to the Preach It! square. Once the sermon is given, or the fine paid, the Study Sheet is returned to the
“bank”.

When the player has finished their sermon (or when the two minutes time limit is up) the person in charge of the
Preach It! cards asks all the players if anybody wants to refute or challenge the preacher. If nobody wants to refute or
challenge the preacher, the player that preached receives the amount of X! indicated by the square they landed on.

The person wishing to refute or challenge the preacher must have at least 1 X! - To REFUTE the preacher is to
argue that the conclusion the preacher took (true, depends or false) is incorrect. To CHALLENGE the preacher is to
argue that the sermon or the Bible reference the preacher gave was not convincing, or that the Bible reference they
gave was incorrect (even if the conclusion and argument was correct).


Refuting

In case someone chooses to REFUTE the preacher, the refutor announces they wish to refute, and they are then given
the Preach It! card (that the preacher used) and they now have two minutes to first read the Preach It! card out loud
and choose their own conclusion (true, depends or false) which must be DIFFERENT to the conclusion taken by the
first preacher, and then to give a convincing argument of their own, also with at least 1 Bible reference, to support
their sermon.

After the refutor has given their sermon, the orignal preacher is given another 1 minute (only) to counter-argue the
sermon of the refutor and have the last word, defending why they believe their original conclusion was correct.

When that final minute is over, there is a call for votes from all the players to decide whose sermon they support. All
players must vote. The person who receives the most votes, receives 1 X! from the other preacher AND the amount
of X! indicated by the Preach It! square landed on. In case of a tie of votes, the original preacher receives the amount
of X! indicated by the Preach It! square, and the refutor receives 1 X!


Challenging

In case someone chooses to CHALLENGE the preacher, the challenger announces they wish to challenge, and they
state the nature of their challenge (e.g. whether it is because of an incorrect or unconvincing Bible reference, or
because of an unconvincing sermon/argument)

If it is a challenge with regard to the Bible reference given, they ask the preacher to read out the Bible reference
stated in the sermon. After reading out the Bible reference (from the Bible), there is a call to votes for all the players
to decide whether that Bible reference was correct or relevant to the argument presented in the preacher's sermon. If
the preacher loses the votes, the sermon is considered void, and the original preacher must pay a fine of 1 X! to thechallenger, and pay “the bank” the amount of X! belonging to the Preach It! square they landed on. (In case of not
having enough X!, they pay every X! they have). If the preacher wins the votes, then the challenger must pay 1 X! to
the preacher, and the preacher receives from the bank the amount of X! indicated by the Preach It! square.

If the challenge is with regard to the preacher not giving a convincing sermon or argument, then the challenger
is given the Preach It! card (that the preacher used) and they now have two minutes to first read the Preach It! card
out loud and then explain why the preacher's original sermon was not convincing. After the challenger gives their
reasons, there is a call to votes for all the players to decide whether the original preacher's sermon was convincing or
not. If the preacher loses the votes, the preacher still receives the amount of X! indicated by the Preach It! square
they landed on but gives 1 X! to the challenger. If the preacher wins the votes, the preacher receives the amount of
X! indicated by the Preach It! square they landed on, PLUS 1 X! from the challenger.


PRISON: The player goes to prison. The player moves their Disciple Token into the prison area labelled “2 Turns”.
The player rolls the die to see if they can shorten their sentence. If they get a 1 with the die, they immediately move
their Disciple Token to the area that indicates “1 Turn” and immediately follow the procedure for the “1 Turn” area as
explained below. If they get any other number they stay in the “2 Turns” area until the following turn.

Upon the following turn, if they are in the “2 Turns” area, they move their Disciple Token to the “1 Turn” area and
follow the procedure indicated in the next paragraph.

When they enter the area labelled “1 Turn” they roll the die to see if they can reduce their sentence and go
immediately to Opportunity! If they get a 1 with the die, they immediately move their Disciple Token to the
Opportunity! square (at the start of the Training section, indicated by the arrow from the Prison to the Opportunity!
square) and they are read an Opportunity! card. They will start their next turn from that Opportunity! square and
move freely once again around the board. If they get any other number, they stay in the “1 Turn” area until their next
turn.

If upon the next turn, they are in the, “1 Turn” area, then they move their Disciple to the Opportunity! square (at the
start of the Training section, indicated by the arrow from the Prison to the Opportunity! square) but they are not read
out an Opportunity! card. They wait there till their following turn, when they will start moving freely once again
around the board.

*Miraculous freedom: Should any player land on a Prayer square, any other players in prison are automatically freed
and moved to the Opportunity! square (at the start of the Training section, indicated by the arrow from the Prison to
the Opportunity! square) from where they start their next turn, though they are not read an Opportunity! card.


HITCH HIKE: The player is given another turn to roll the die or dice. If the player had rolled two dice
previously, they now roll two dice again and move their Disciple(s) accordingly. If the player had rolled only one die,
then they roll one die again. And the new square that they land on is now activated for their turn.


PERSECUTION: The player is under persecution and must throw one of the dice to determine their outcome,
according to the following chart:
1 = ESCAPE. The player may escape by taking any train to any other empty station.
2 = PRISON. The player is arrested and puts their Disciple in the “2 Turns” area of Prison and follows the procedure
for the Prison square as explained previously.
3 = MARTYRDOM. The player is taken to the torture chambers, (labelled “Martyrdom” on the board) where they
will await their fate on their next turn, according to the procedures of “Martyrdom” explained below.
4 = PRISON.
5 = MARTYRDOM.
6 = THE SYSTEM. The player's Disciple does not lose any tokens but goes back to “The System” from where they
must follow the procedure of leaving The System in future by rolling only one die.


MARTYRDOM: The player reaches the Martyrdom area of the board by rolling a 3 or 5 under Persecution or
through an Opportunity! card. When the player first reaches Martyrdom, they remain there until their following turn.
On their next turn, they roll a die to determine their fate, according to the following chart:
1 = HEAVEN. The player goes direct to Heaven without any Exam.2 = DOUBLE DICE MVC. The player rolls two dice and receives double the number in MVC for an Exam. The
player is tested on that amount of MVC and must pass every single one. Each one they pass is returned to the bottom
of the MVC pile. As soon as they fail one MVC, they are given the one they failed and the remaining MVC they had
to pass, to study until their next turn, when they will be tested again. As soon as they pass ALL MVC in this way,
they go to Heaven. NOTE: If the player already had MVC, they may use those to be tested on first and as part of the
number of MVC they have to pass. And if the player has Bible Tokens, they may use 1 Bible Token for each MVC
they wish to cancel having to pass. (See Exam! for details on how to conduct the Exams)
3 = TRIPLE DICE MVC. Same as number 2, but receives triple the number of MVC as shown by the dice!
4 = PRISON. The player is arrested and puts their Disciple in the “2 Turns” area of Prison and follows the procedure
for the Prison square as explained previously.
5 = DOUBLE DICE MVC. Same as number 2.
6 = TORTURE BY THE PEOPLE. The other players agree on (by consensus or voting) an activity to inflict as
torture onto the player. This may be some sort of physical exercise, eating certain foods, doing something
embarrassing, etc. If the player submits to the torture inflicted by the people, they go directly to Heaven without an
Exam. The player has the option of choosing NOT to submit to the torture, in which case, they lose any X! they
currently have (but keep any other Tokens) and their Disciple goes back to “The System” to start from there.
However, the person whose idea it was for that particular torture must now submit to the torture they suggested
themselves. If they do not, they also lose all the X! they have, though their disciple does not go back to “The
System”. If this player does submit to their own torture suggestion, they earn 3 X!
In the event that a player reaches Heaven through Martyrdom before getting another Disciple, they are automatically
given one, which is placed in “The System”. If the player has 4 X! (normally required to exchange for a Disciple)
they give those X! (or as many as they have if they have less) to the bank.


TRACTS X 2: The player receives two Tracts. The tracts can be used when the player has to preach and does not
wish to do so (be it to save time, or because they are not comfortable with the argument raised by the Preach It! card).
Regardless of how many X! the player would normally win from Preach It!, if they decide to use a Tract instead of
preaching, they receive 1X! at the time of handing the Tract in.


PRIZE!: The player receives a prize. They may choose between any of the following prizes:
1 Disciple
2 Bible Tokens
2 Fellowship Tokens
2 Tracts
4 Memory Verse Cards (MVC)


THE PATH OF TRIBULATIONS: This path is marked by the grey squares that lead from the two
Persecution squares on the outer path to the Exam! pit, which in turn leads to Heaven. To enter the Path of
Tribulations, the player must have 3 X! available to be handed to the “bank” upon entering. They must also have
thrown only one die.
Some of the squares along the Path of Tribulations are the same as those explained before, with the exception of the
Lessons square (symbolized by a light bulb) and the Exam! pit.


LESSONS: The player shares a personal spiritual lesson they have learned from their life recently (that week
or month), or from the preaching during the game. After sharing a lesson, they receive 1 X!


EXAM!: Regardless of the number rolled with the die, when the player reaches Exam! they remain there till
they pass an Exam with the MVC. They roll two dice and the sum of the dice is the number of MVC they will be
tested on. The player is tested on that amount of MVC and must pass every single one. Each one they pass is
returned to the bottom of the MVC pile. As soon as they fail one MVC, they are given the one they failed and the
remaining MVC they had to pass (but had not been tested on), to study until their next turn, when they will be tested
again. As soon as they pass ALL MVC in this way, they go to Heaven. NOTE: If the player already had MVC, they
may use those to be tested on first and as part of the total number of MVC they have to pass. And if the player has
Bible Tokens, they may use 1 Bible Token for each MVC they wish to cancel having to pass. The player may not go
to Heaven until all their MVC have been passed.The exam is conducted by the person in charge of the MVC (or by another player if the person being tested is the
person in charge). The examiner reads out the front of the MVC (which has a statement, e.g. “Jesus is the only way
to God”) while conceiling the back of the MVC, and the player being tested must answer correctly the book(s) and
chapter(s) in the Bible where that statement is found, as detailed on the back of the MVC. If they pass that MVC, it is
returned to the pile. If not, it is handed to the player (along with the other MVC they have to pass) and the exam is
put on hold until that player's next turn.


HEAVEN: When a player reaches Heaven there is a celebration! The player rolls a die to determine how
everyone will celebrate that person's entrance into Heaven, according to the following chart:
1 or 4 = Care. Every player gives a hug to every other player.
2 or 5 = Chorus. The player leads others in a short song, chorus or hymn of their choice.
3 or 6 = Compliments. Each player gives a public compliment to the player on their right. (If this celebration is
repeated again, it changes to give a compliment to every player on the left, and then to every second player, etc. so
that each time it comes up, each player is giving a compliment to someone they haven't complimented before)
TIPS:


Playing With Inexperienced Players:
If playing with someone who is new to the game and has very little Biblical knowledge, you may make an exception
and require more knowledgeable players to enter one more disciple into Heaven than the inexperienced player. Also,
when the inexperienced player lands on a Preach It! square, regardless of what colour the square is, you may give
them the yellow (beginner) Preach It! cards to read, as the orange (intermediate) and red (advanced) cards contain
more complex and subtle arguments that could confuse them. Another tip is to let them hold on to the Study Sheet
throughout the game so they can refer to it each time they land on a Preach It! square and at other times.
You may desist from challenging (and even refuting, unless the argument they present is really spiritually unhealthy)
an inexperienced player to encourage them with having given it a go. If they have constant access to the Study Sheet,
and they are encouraged to use it, they should be able to come up with sound arguments themselves. Avoid trying to
tell them what the right answer is, rather ask them to look for it via the Study Sheet and to read from the Bible
whatever verse they choose to support their argument. This makes the process take a bit more time, but it is very
helpful in getting inexperienced players to learn to think for themselves and to discover key Bible verses.
If an inexperienced player lands on Martyrdom, you may decide to give them only the number of MVC they get with
the dice, instead of double, or triple as per the normal rules of Martyrdom. This will make it easier for them to learn a
few MVC, will enjoy the game more, and will likely want to play again.


Playing With Experienced Players:
Fellowship Tokens are most helpful for inexperienced players, as they can choose someone else to preach in their
stead. However, with experienced players, these tokens are rarely used, and so there could be an understanding that
they can be traded back to the bank for 2 X!
To make some of the sermons a little more challenging for experienced players, you may require players to actually
read out one Bible verse to support the sermon they give. This forces the player to first remember where to find the
verse they want to use, and also to sharpen their sermon by limiting their time. More often than not, reading out the
verse is a sermon in itself, as the verse often answers the argument by itself.
Another challenge is to ask experienced players to cite the actual verse number they are quoting be it in their
sermons, or when tested with MVC, although this latter option increases the difficulty quite a bit.
The option to challenge another player's sermon (on the basis that it was not convincing enough) should be
encouraged between experienced players, as this will help everyone sharpen their understanding and the arguments
used to support a point.
